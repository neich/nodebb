# nodebb

This application is intended to show good practices when building Single Page Applications with Backbone. It is used for educational purposes. The server side is provided by an extended version of [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) that provides authentication, authorization, and a basic integration of [`peerjs-server`](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server): [`json-server-plus`](https://github.com/neich/json-server-plus) 

It enforces several principles:

* Separation of concerns. This is applied to both client and server:
  * Client: Model View Presenter
* Low coupling: each component of the application is designed to be reused

The technologies used are:

* Express.js 4
* Webpack 4
* Backbone 1.3
* Bootstrap 4

To run the application:

- Clone and execute [`json-server-plus`](https://github.com/neich/json-server-plus)
- Clone this repo
- Execute `yarn`
- Execute `npm run start`. This starts a [webpack dev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
- Load the project at `http://localhost:9000`


## The App

This is a very simple application that managed two entities:

* Users
* Orders

And Order belongs to a user, and a user can own multiple orders
